  <h1>Broadband Forum User Services Platform (USP) Data Models</h1>
  <p>The Broadband Forum defines several data models for use with the <a href="http://usp.technology">User Services
  Platform (USP) (TR-369)</a>. These data models contain objects, parameters,
  commands, and events that describe the many different service elements that
  can be exposed via USP Agents.</p>

  <p>USP data models are divided into two types: Root and Service. The root data
  model, Device, is used to describe the major functions of network aware
  devices, including interfaces, software/firmware, diagnostics, components
  common to USP and other services, and the basic Agent information necessary
  to the operation of USP.</p>

  <p>Service data models describe modular functionality that allow the extension of
  the root data model on a device (under Device.Services.) to provide particular
  services, such as a voice service, set top box service, network attached
  storage, smart home objects, etc.</p>

  <p>Each data model is defined by a Name:Version syntax. The objects, parameters,
  commands, and events that a particular Agent supports from its implementation of
  the data model define what is reported to Controllers via the GetSupportedDM
  message.</p>

  <h2>How do I use these?</h2>

  <p>Use the USP data model files to define and implement what exists in your solution's
  <i>Supported Data Model</i>. This will help Controllers learn what your
  solution is capable of. The data models will also describe how your solution's
  <i>Instantiated Data Model</i> will behave during operation.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>View the html files on this page for a human-readable look at the data
      model documentation.</li>
    <li>Use the xml files in this repository when generating code and performing
      data validation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These data models are based off of the <a href="http://www.broadband-forum.org">
    Broadband Forum</a>'s <a href="http://github.com/BroadbandForum/cwmp-data-model">data models for the CPE WAN Management Protocol</a>,
    also known as "TR-069", with a robust development history.</p>

  <p>The source files used to build the complete USP data model can be found on
    Github:</p>
